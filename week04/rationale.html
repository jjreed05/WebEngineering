  <h1>Subject: Presenting Information</h1>

    Guideline</a></h2>
  <p>In this website, I made changes in the architecture of presenting information. The first version of the 
     website did not have a format that followed normal web conventions. The original had the body stretched 
     out from one side of the page to the other. In this version, I added left and right columns to focus
     the main body in the center.</p>

  <h1>Subject: Navigation</h1>
  <h2><a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">Guidline</a></h2>
  <p>I followed the conventions for providing a sense of a landmark in the website. I utilized the left hand
     hand column to tell the user which page they are on. Additionally, I did have a navigation bar in my 
     original website. The left hand column and the navigation bar allow a better sense of navigation. </p>

  <h1>Subject: Graphics</h1>
  <h2><a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/2-graphics-as-content.html">Guidline</a></h2>
  <p>I wanted to add a graphic to give the website a sense of identity, but I did not want the graphic to 
     take away from the original design. So, I added a peace dollar picture to the right side bar for both 
     pages to exemplify the token of the business.</p>
